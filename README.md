actionlint
==========
[![CI Badge][]][CI]
[![API Document][api-badge]][apidoc]

[actionlint][repo] is a static checker for GitHub Actions workflow files. [Try it online!][playground]

Features:

- **Syntax check for workflow files** to check unexpected or missing keys following [workflow syntax][syntax-doc]
- **Strong type check for `${{ }}` expressions** to catch several semantic errors like access to not existing property,
  type mismatches, ...
- **Actions usage check** to check that inputs at `with:` and outputs in `steps.{id}.outputs` are correct
- **[shellcheck][] and [pyflakes][] integrations** for scripts in `run:`
- **Other several useful checks**; [glob syntax][filter-pattern-doc] validation, dependencies check for `needs:`,
  runner label validation, cron syntax validation, ...

See ['Checks' section](#checks) for full list of checks done by actionlint.

**Example of broken workflow:**

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branch: main
    tags:
      - 'v\d+'
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [macos-latest, linux-latest]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ matrix.platform }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
        if: ${{ github.repository.permissions.admin == true }}
      - run: npm install && npm test
```

Basically all you need to do is running `acitonlint` command in your repository. actionlint automatically detects workflows in
your repository and reports errors in them. actionlint focuses on finding out mistakes. It tries to catch errors as much as
possible and make false positives as minimal as possible.

# Why?

- **Running workflow is time consuming.** You need to push the changes and wait until the workflow runs on GitHub even if
  it contains some trivial mistakes. [act][] is useful to run the workflow locally. But it is not suitable for CI and still
  time consuming when your workflow gets larger.
- **Checks of workflow files by GitHub are very loose.** It reports no error even if unexpected keys are in mappings
  (meant that some typos in keys). And also it reports no error when accessing to property which is actually not existing.
  For example `matrix.foo` when no `foo` is defined in `matrix:` section, it is evaluated to `null` and causes no error.
- **Some mistakes silently break a workflow.** Most common case I saw is specifying missing property to cache key. In the
  case cache silently does not work properly but workflow itself runs without error. So you might not notice the mistake
  forever.

# Install

## [Homebrew][homebrew] on macOS

Tap this repository and install `actionlint` package.

```sh
brew tap "rhysd/actionlint" "https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint"
brew install actionlint
```

## Prebuilt binaries

Download an archive file from [releases page][releases] for your platform, unarchive it and put the executable file to a
directory in `$PATH`.

Prebuilt binaries are built at each release by CI for the following OS and arch:

- macOS (x86_64, arm64)
- Linux (i386, x86_64, arm32, arm64)
- Windows (i386, x86_64)
- FreeBSD (i386, x86_64)

Note: The author doesn't have Apple M1 environment so `darwin/arm64` target binary is not tested.

## CI services

Please try [the download script](./scripts/download-actionlint.bash). It downloads the latest version of actionlint
(`actionlint.exe` on Windows and `actionlint` on other OSes) to the current directory automatically. On GitHub Actions
environment, it sets a file path of downloaded executable to `executable` output in order to use the executable in the
following steps easily.

Here is an example of simple workflow to run actionlint on GitHub Actions. Please ensure `shell: bash` since the default
shell for Windows runners is `pwsh`.

```yaml
name: Lint GitHub Actions workflows
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  actionlint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Download actionlint
        id: get_actionlint
        run: bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhysd/actionlint/main/scripts/download-actionlint.bash)
        shell: bash
      - name: Check workflow files
        run: ${{ steps.get_actionlint.outputs.executable }} -color
        shell: bash
```

or simply run

```yaml
- name: Check workflow files
  run: |
    bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhysd/actionlint/main/scripts/download-actionlint.bash)
    ./actionlint -color
  shell: bash
```

If you want to enable [shellcheck integration](#check-shellcheck-integ), install `shellcheck` command as follows:

```yaml
- name: Install shellcheck to enable shellcheck integration
  run: sudo apt install shellcheck
```

## Build from source

[Go][] toolchain is necessary.

```sh
# Install the latest stable version
go install github.com/rhysd/actionlint/cmd/actionlint@latest

# Install the head of main branch
go install github.com/rhysd/actionlint/cmd/actionlint
```

## Online playground

Thanks to WebAssembly, actionlint playground is available on your browser. It never sends any data to outside of your browser.

https://rhysd.github.io/actionlint/

Paste your workflow content to the code editor at left pane. It automatically shows the results at right pane. When editing
the workflow content in the code editor, the results will be updated on the fly. Clicking an error message in the results
table moves a cursor to position of the error in the code editor.

# Usage

With no argument, actionlint finds all workflow files in the current repository and checks them.

```sh
actionlint
```

When paths to YAML workflow files are given as arguments, actionlint checks them.

```sh
actionlint path/to/workflow1.yaml path/to/workflow2.yaml
```

See `actionlint -h` for all flags and options.

# Tools integration

These tools have integration with actionlint:

- **[reviewdog/action-actionlint][reviewdog-actionlint]**: [reviewdog][] is an automated review tool for various code hosting
  services. It officially supports actionlint. You can check errors from actionlint easily in inline comments on code review.

## Unexpected keys

Example input:

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    step:
```

Output:

```
test.yaml:5:5: unexpected key "step" for "job" section. expected one of "name", "needs", "runs-on", "permissions", "environment", "concurrency", "outputs", "env", "defaults", "if", "steps", "timeout-minutes", "strategy", "continue-on-error", "container", "services" [syntax-check]
  |
5 |     step:
  |     ^~~~~
```

[Playground](https://rhysd.github.io/actionlint#eJzLz7NSKCgtzuDKyk8qtuJSUChJLS4B0QoKRaV5xbr5QPnSpNK8klLdnESQHFiquCS1wAoAMZgSwQ==)

[Workflow syntax][syntax-doc] defines what keys can be defined in which mapping object. When other keys are defined, they
are simply ignored and don't affect workflow behavior. It means typo in keys is not detected by GitHub.

actionlint can detect unexpected keys while parsing workflow syntax and report them as error.

<a name="check-missing-required-duplicate-keys"></a>
## Missing required keys or key duplicates

Example input:

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  test:
    steps:
      - run: echo 'hello'
  TEST:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo 'bye'
```

Output:

```
test.yaml:6:3: key "test" is duplicate in "jobs" section. previously defined at line:3,col:3. note that key names are case insensitive [syntax-check]
  |
6 |   TEST:
  |   ^~~~~
test.yaml:4:5: "runs-on" section is missing in job "test" [syntax-check]
  |
4 |     steps:
  |     ^~~~~~
```

[Playground](https://rhysd.github.io/actionlint#eJzLz7NSKCgtzuDKyk8qtuJSUChJLS4B0QoKxSWpBcUQpoKCrkJRKVBpanJGvoJ6RmpOTr46UCbENTgEogIoW6ybD1RRmlSaV1Kqm5MIMoiAOUmVqeoAYX8k5Q==)

Some mappings must include specific keys. For example, job mapping must include `runs-on:` and `steps:`.

And duplicate in keys is not allowed. In workflow syntax, comparing keys is **case insensitive**. For example, job ID
`test` in lower case and job ID `TEST` in upper case are not able to exist in the same workflow.

actionlint checks these missing required keys and duplicate of keys while parsing, and reports an error.

<a name="check-empty-mapping"></a>
## Unexpected empty mappings

Example input:

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
```

Output:

```
test.yaml:2:6: "jobs" section should not be empty. please remove this section if it's unnecessary [syntax-check]
  |
2 | jobs:
  |      ^
```

[Playground](https://rhysd.github.io/actionlint#eJzLz7NSKCgtzuDKyk8qtgIAJQsE6g==)

Some mappings and sequences should not be empty. For example, `steps:` must include at least one step.

actionlint checks such mappings and sequences are not empty while parsing, and reports the empty mappings and sequences as error.

<a name="check-mapping-values"></a>
## Unexpected mapping values

Example input:

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      # ERROR: Boolean value "true" or "false" is expected
      fail-fast: off
      # ERROR: Integer value is expected
      max-parallel: 1.5
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: sleep 200
        # ERROR: Float value is expected
        timeout-minutes: two minutes
```

Output:

```
test.yaml:6:18: expecting a string with ${{...}} expression or boolean literal "true" or "false", but found plain text node [syntax-check]
  |
6 |       fail-fast: off
  |                  ^~~
test.yaml:8:21: expected scalar node for integer value but found scalar node with "!!float" tag [syntax-check]
  |
8 |       max-parallel: 1.5
  |                     ^~~
test.yaml:13:26: expecting a string with ${{...}} expression or float number literal, but found plain text node [syntax-check]
   |
13 |         timeout-minutes: two minutes
   |                          ^~~
```

[Playground](https://rhysd.github.io/actionlint#eJw1jssNAjEMRO9bxTQQtCBxSTdeyYGg/BTbArongXCy5o395Fo8msl9e9RD/AYoi84JiHZSvr1/CQgUkws0atQQFsz0co06pcTJ43y6fnm3Iq4OtR1W1FyiqV1WbvJXurnpIYm54bLvC48vYuZq6nIsNk499FmxwgdsuTVm)

Some mapping's values are restricted to some constant strings. Several mapping values expect boolean value like `true` or
`false`. And some mapping values expect integer or floating number values.

actionlint checks such constant strings are used properly while parsing, and reports an error when unexpected value is
specified.

<a name="check-syntax-expression"></a>
## Syntax check for expression `${{ }}`

Example input:

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # " is not available for string literal delimiter
      - run: echo '${{ "hello" }}'
      # + operator does not exist
      - run: echo '${{ 1 + 1 }}'
      # Missing ')' paren
      - run: echo "${{ toJson(hashFiles('**/lock', '**/cache/') }}"
      # unexpected end of input
      - run: echo '${{ github.event. }}'
```

Output:

```
test.yaml:7:25: got unexpected character '"' while lexing expression, expecting '_', '\'', '}', '(', ')', '[', ']', '.', '!', '<', '>', '=', '&', ... [expression]
  |
7 |       - run: echo '${{ "hello" }}'

   |                                                                 ^~~
test.yaml:13:38: unexpected end of input while parsing object property dereference like 'a.b' or array element dereference like 'a.*'. expecting "IDENT", "*" [expression]
   |
13 |       - run: echo '${{ github.event. }}'
   |                                      ^~~

actionlint lexes and parses expression in `${{ }}` following [the expression syntax document][expr-doc]. It can detect
many syntax errors like invalid characters, missing parens, unexpected end of input, ...

<a name="check-type-check-expression"></a>
## Type checks for expression syntax in `${{ }}`

Example input:

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Basic type error like index access to object
      - run: echo '${{ env[0] }}'
      # Properties in objects are strongly typed. So missing property can be caught
      - run: echo '${{ job.container.os }}'
      # github.repository is string. So accessing .owner is invalid
      - run: echo '${{ github.repository.owner }}'
```

Output:

```

Type checks for expression syntax in `${{ }}` are done by semantics checker. Note that actual type checks by GitHub Actions
runtime is loose. For example any object value can be assigned into string value as string `"Object"`. But such loose
conversions are bugs in almost all cases. actionlint checks types more strictly.

There are two types of object types internally. One is an object which is strict for properties, which causes a type error
when trying to access to unknown properties. And another is an object which is not strict for properties, which allows to
access to unknown properties. In the case, accessing to unknown property is typed as `any`.

When the type check cannot be done statically, the type is deduced to `any` (e.g. return type from `toJSON()`).

And `${{ }}` can be used for expanding values.

Example input:

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        env_string:
          - 'FOO=BAR'
          - 'FOO=PIYO'
        env_object:
          - FOO: BAR
          - FOO: PIYO
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Expanding object at 'env:' section
      - run: echo "$FOO"
        env: ${{ matrix.env_object }}
      # String value cannot be expanded as object
      - run: echo "$FOO"
        env: ${{ matrix.env_string }}
```

Output:

```
test.yaml:19:14: type of expression at "env" must be object but found type string [expression]
   |
19 |         env: ${{ matrix.env_string }}
   |              ^~~
```

In above example, environment variables mapping is expanded at `env:` section. actionlint checks type of the expanded value.

[Contexts][contexts-doc] and [built-in functions][funcs-doc] are strongly typed. Typos in property access of contexts and
function names can be checked. And invalid function calls like wrong number of arguments or type mismatch at parameter also
can be checked thanks to type checker.

The semantics checker can properly handle that

- some functions are overloaded (e.g. `contains(str, substr)` and `contains(array, item)`)
- some parameters are optional (e.g. `join(strings, sep)` and `join(strings)`)
- some parameters are repeatable (e.g. `hashFiles(file1, file2, ...)`)

In addition, `format()` function has special check for placeholders in the first parameter which represents formatting string.

Note that context names and function names are case insensitive. For example, `toJSON` and `toJson` are the same function.

## Contextual typing for `steps.<step_id>` objects

Example input:

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      # Step outputs can be used in job outputs since this section is evaluated after all steps were run
      foo: '${{ steps.get_value.outputs.name }}'
    steps:
      # ERROR: Access to undefined step outputs
      - run: echo '${{ steps.get_value.outputs.name }}'
      # Outputs are set here
      - run: echo '::set-output name=foo::value'
        id: get_value
      # OK
      - run: echo '${{ steps.get_value.outputs.name }}'
      # OK
      - run: echo '${{ steps.get_value.conclusion }}'
  other:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # ERROR: Access to undefined step outputs. Step objects are job-local
      - run: echo '${{ steps.get_value.outputs.name }}'
```

Output:

```

Outputs of step can be accessed via `steps.<step_id>` objects. The `steps` context is dynamic:

- Accessing to the outputs before running the step are `null`
- Outputs of steps only in the job can be accessed. It cannot access to steps across jobs

It is actually common mistake to access to the wrong step outputs since people often forget fixing placeholders on
copying&pasting steps. actionlint can catch the invalid accesses to step outputs and reports them as errors.

When the outputs are set by popular actions, the outputs object is more strictly typed.

Example input:

```yaml
on: push

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # ERROR: The step is not run yet at this point
      - run: echo ${{ steps.cache.outputs.cache-hit }}
      # actions/cache sets cache-hit output
      - uses: actions/cache@v2
        id: cache
        with:
          key: ${{ hashFiles('**/*.lock') }}
          path: ./packages
      # OK
      - run: echo ${{ steps.cache.outputs.cache-hit }}
      # ERROR: Typo at output name
      - run: echo ${{ steps.cache.outputs.cache_hit }}
```

Output:

```
test.yaml:8:23: property "cache" is not defined in object type {} [expression]

In the above example, [actions/cache][actions-cache] action sets `cache-hit` output so that following steps can know the
cache was hit or not. At line 8, the cache action is not run yet. So `cache` property does not exit in `steps` context yet.
On running the step whose ID is `cache`, `steps.cache` object is typed as `{outputs: {cache-hit: any}, conclusion: string, outcome: string}`.
At line 18, the expression has typo in output name. actionlint can check it because properties of `steps.cache.outputs` are
typed.

This strict outputs typing is also applied to local actions. Let's say we have the following local action.

```yaml
name: 'My action with output'
author: 'rhysd <https://rhysd.github.io>'
description: 'my action with outputs'

outputs:
  some_value:
    description: some value returned from this action

runs:
  using: 'node14'
  main: 'index.js'
```

Example input:

```yaml
on: push

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # ERROR: The step is not yet run
      - run: echo ${{ steps.my_action.outputs.some_value }}
      # The action runs here and sets its outputs
      - uses: ./.github/actions/my-action-with-output
        id: my_action
      # OK
      - run: echo ${{ steps.my_action.outputs.some_value }}
      # ERROR: No output named 'some-value' (typo)
      - run: echo ${{ steps.my_action.outputs.some-value }}
```

Output:

```
test.yaml:8:23: property "my_action" is not defined in object type {} [expression]
  |
8 |       - run: echo ${{ steps.my_action.outputs.some_value }}
  |                       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
test.yaml:15:23: property "some-value" is not defined in object type {some_value: any} [expression]
   |
15 |       - run: echo ${{ steps.my_action.outputs.some-value }}
   |                       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

The 'My action with output' action defines one output `some_value`. The property is typed at `steps.my_action.outputs` object
so that actionlint can check incorrect property accesses like a typo in output name.

Types of `matrix` context is contextually checked by the semantics checker. Type of matrix values in `matrix:` section
is deduced from element values of its array. When the matrix value is an array of objects, objects' properties are checked
strictly like `package.name` in above example.

When type of the array elements is not persistent, type of the matrix value falls back to `any`.

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    foo:
      - 'string value'
      - 42
      - {aaa: true, bbb: null}
    bar:
      - [42]
      - [true]
      - [{aaa: true, bbb: null}]
      - []
steps:
  # matrix.foo is any type value
  - run: echo ${{ matrix.foo }}
  # matrix.bar is array<any> type value

Job dependencies can be defined at [`needs:`][needs-doc]. A job runs after all jobs defined in `needs:` are done.
Outputs from the jobs can be accessed only from jobs following them via [`needs` context][needs-context-doc].

actionlint defines type of `needs` variable contextually looking at each job's `outputs:` section and `needs:` section.

      # shellcheck is not run in this case.
      - run: echo $FOO
      # This script is run with bash due to 'shell:' configuration
      - run: echo $FOO
        shell: bash
```

```

   |         ^~~~
```

[shellcheck][] is a famous linter for ShellScript. actionlint runs shellcheck for scripts at `run:` step in workflow.
For installing shellcheck, see [the official installation document][shellcheck-install].

actionlint detects which shell is used to run the scripts following [the documentation][shell-doc]. On Linux or macOS,
the default shell is `bash` and on Windows it is `pwsh`. Shell can be configured by `shell:` configuration at workflow level
or job level. Each step can configure shell to run scripts by `shell:`.

actionlint remembers the default shell and checks what OS the job runs on. Only when the shell is `bash` or `sh`, actionlint
applies shellcheck to scripts.

By default, actionlint checks if `shellcheck` command exists in your system and uses it when it is found. The `-shellcheck`
option on running `actionlint` command specifies the executable path of shellcheck. Setting empty string by `shellcheck=`
disables shellcheck integration explicitly.

Since both `${{ }}` expression syntax and ShellScript's variable access `$FOO` use `$`, remaining `${{ }}` confuses shellcheck.
To avoid it, actionlint replaces `${{ }}` with underscores. For example `echo '${{ matrix.os }}'` is replaced with
`echo '________________'`.

Python script can be written in `run:` when `shell: python` is configured.

[pyflakes][] is a famous linter for Python. It is suitable for linting small code like scripts at `run:` since it focuses
on finding mistakes (not a code style issue) and tries to make false positives as minimal as possible. Install pyflakes
by `pip install pyflakes`.

actionlint runs pyflakes for scripts at `run:` steps in workflow and reports errors found by pyflakes. actionlint detects
Python scripts in workflow by checking `shell: python` at steps and `defaults:` configurations at workflows and jobs.

By default, actionlint checks if `pyflakes` command exists in your system and uses it when found. The `-pyflakes` option
of `actionlint` command allows to specify the executable path of pyflakes. Setting empty string by `pyflakes=` disables
pyflakes integration explicitly.

Since both `${{ }}` expression syntax is invalid as Python, remaining `${{ }}` might confuse pyflakes. To avoid it,
actionlint replaces `${{ }}` with underscores. For example `print('${{ matrix.os }}')` is replaced with
`print('________________')`.

[`matrix:`][matrix-doc] defines combinations of multiple values. Nested `include:` and `exclude:` can add/remove specific
combination of matrix values. actionlint checks

- values in `exclude:` appear in `matrix:` or `include:`
- duplicate in variations of matrix values

At `on:`, Webhook events can be specified to trigger the workflow. [Webhook event documentation][webhook-doc] defines
which Webhook events are available and what types can be specified at `types:` for each event.

actionlint validates the Webhook configurations:

- unknown Webhook event name
- unknown type for Webhook event
- invalid filter names

For filtering branches, tags and paths in Webhook events, [glob syntax][filter-pattern-doc] is available.
actionlint validates glob patterns `branches:`, `branches-ignore:`, `tags:`, `tags-ignore:`, `paths:`, `paths-ignore:` in a
workflow. It checks:

- syntax errors like missing closing brackets for character range `[..]`
- invalid usage like `?` following `*`, invalid character range `[9-1]`, ...
- invalid character usage for Git ref names (branch name, tag name)
  - ref name cannot start/end with `/`
  - ref name cannot contain `[`, `:`, `\`, ...

Most common mistake I have ever seen here is misunderstanding that regular expression is available for filtering. This rule
can catch the mistake so that users can notice their mistakes.

To trigger a workflow in specific interval, [scheduled event][schedule-event-doc] can be defined in [POSIX CRON syntax][cron-syntax].

actionlint checks the CRON syntax and frequency of running the job. When a job is run more frequently than once per 1 minute,
actionlint reports it as error.

GitHub Actions provides two kinds of job runners, [GitHub-hosted runner][gh-hosted-runner] and [self-hosted runner][self-hosted-runner].
Each runner has one or more labels. GitHub Actions runtime finds a proper runner based on label(s) specified at `runs-on:`
to run the job. So specifying proper labels at `runs-on:` is important.

actionlint checks proper label is used at `runs-on:` configuration. Even if an expression is used in the section like
`runs-on: ${{ matrix.foo }}`, actionlint parses the expression and resolves the possible values, then validates the values.

When you define some custom labels for your self-hosted runner, actionlint does not know the labels. Please set the label
names in [`actionlint.yaml` configuration file](#config-file) to let actionlint know them.

Action needs to be specified in a format defined in [the document][action-uses-doc]. There are 3 types of actions:

- action hosted on GitHub: `owner/repo/path@ref`
- local action: `./path/to/my-action`
- Docker action: `docker://image:tag`

actionlint checks values at `uses:` sections follow one of these formats.

## Local action inputs validation at `with:`

My action definition at `.github/actions/my-action/action.yaml`:

```yaml
name: 'My action'

description: 'my action'

inputs:
  name:
    description: your name
    default: anonymous
  message:
    description: message to this action
    required: true
  addition:
    description: additional information
    required: false

runs:
  using: 'node14'
  main: 'index.js'
```

Example input:

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # missing required input "message"
      - uses: ./.github/actions/my-action
      # unexpected input "additions"
      - uses: ./.github/actions/my-action
        with:
          name: rhysd
          message: hello
          additions: foo, bar
```

Output:

```
test.yaml:7:15: missing input "message" which is required by action "My action" defined at "./.github/actions/my-action". all required inputs are "message" [action]
  |
7 |       - uses: ./.github/actions/my-action

   |
13 |           additions: foo, bar
   |           ^~~~~~~~~~
```

When a local action is run in `uses:` of `step:`, actionlint reads `action.yml` file in the local action directory and
validates inputs at `with:` in the workflow are correct. Missing required inputs and unexpected inputs can be detected.

actionlint checks inputs of many popular actions such as `actions/checkout@v2`. It checks

- some input is required by the action but it not set at `with:`
- input set at `with:` is not defined in the action (this commonly occurs by typo)

this is done by checking `with:` section items with a small database collected at building `actionlint` binary. actionlint
can check popular actions without fetching any `action.yml` of the actions from remote so that it can run efficiently.

Currently actionlint supports more than 100 popular actions The data are put at [`popular_actions.go`](./popular_actions.go)
and were automatically collected by [a script][generate-popular-actions]. If you want more checks for other actions, please
make a request [as an issue][issue-form].

`=` must not be included in environment variable names. And `&` and spaces should not be included in them. In almost all
cases they are mistakes and they may cause some issues on using them in shell since they have special meaning in shell syntax.

Permissions of `GITHUB_TOKEN` token can be configured at workflow-level or job-level by [`permissions:` section][perm-config-doc].
actionlint checks permission scopes and permission values in workflow are correct.

<a name="config-file"></a>
# Configuration file

Configuration file `actionlint.yaml` or `actionlint.yml` can be put in `.github` directory.

You don't need to write first configuration file by your hand. `actionlint` command can generate a default configuration.

```sh
actionlint -init-config
vim .github/actionlint.yaml
```

Since the author tries to keep configuration file as minimal as possible, currently only one item can be configured.

```yaml
self-hosted-runner:
  # Labels of self-hosted runner in array of string
  labels:
    - linux.2xlarge
    - windows-latest-xl
    - linux-multi-gpu
```

- `self-hosted-runner`: Configuration for your self-hosted runner environment
  - `labels`: Label names added to your self-hosted runners as list of string

Note that configuration file is optional. The author tries to keep configuration file as minimal as possible not to
bother users to configure behavior of actionlint. Running actionlint without configuration file would work fine in most
cases.

# Exit status

`actionlint` command exits with one of the following exit statuses.

| Status | Description                                             |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `0`    | The command ran successfully and no problem was found   |
| `1`    | The command ran successfully and some problem was found |
| `2`    | The command failed due to invalid command line option   |
| `3`    | The command failed due to some fatal error              |

# Use actionlint as library

actionlint can be used from Go programs. See [the documentation][apidoc] to know the list of all APIs. It contains
workflow file parser built on top of `go-yaml/yaml`, expression `${{ }}` lexer/parser/checker, etc.
Followings are unexhaustive list of interesting APIs.

- `Command` struct represents entire `actionlint` command. `Command.Main` takes command line arguments and runs command
  until the end and returns exit status.
- `Linter` manages linter lifecycle and applies checks to given files. If you want to run actionlint checks in your
  program, please use this struct.
- `Project` and `Projects` detect a project (Git repository) in a given directory path and find configuration in it.
- `Config` represents structure of `actionlint.yaml` config file. It can be decoded by [go-yaml/yaml][go-yaml] library.
- `Workflow`, `Job`, `Step`, ... are nodes of workflow syntax tree. `Workflow` is a root node.
- `Parse()` parses given contents into a workflow syntax tree. It tries to find syntax errors as much as possible and
  returns found errors as slice.
- `Pass` is a visitor to traverse a workflow syntax tree. Multiple passes can be applied at single pass using `Visitor`.
- `Rule` is an interface for rule checkers and `RuneBase` is a base struct to implement a rule checker.
  - `RuleExpression` is a rule checker to check expression syntax in `${{ }}`.
  - `RuleShellcheck` is a rule checker to apply `shellcheck` command to `run:` sections and collect errors from it.
  - `RuleJobNeeds` is a rule checker to check dependencies in `needs:` section. It can detect cyclic dependencies.
  - ...
- `ExprLexer` lexes expression syntax in `${{ }}` and returns slice of `Token`.
- `ExprParser` parses given slice of `Token` and returns syntax tree for expression in `${{ }}`. `ExprNode` is an
  interface for nodes in the expression syntax tree.
- `ExprType` is an interface of types in expression syntax `${{ }}`. `ObjectType`, `ArrayType`, `StringType`,
  `NumberType`, ... are structs to represent actual types of expression.
- `ExprSemanticsChecker` checks semantics of expression syntax `${{ }}`. It traverses given expression syntax tree and
  deduces its type, checking types and resolving variables (contexts).
- `ValidateRefGlob()` and `ValidatePathGlob()` validate [glob filter pattern][filter-pattern-doc] and returns all errors
  found by the validator.
- `ActionMetadata` is a struct for action metadata file (`action.yml`). It is used to check inputs specified at `with:`
  and typing `steps.{id}.outputs` object strictly.
- `PopularActions` global variable is data set of popular actions' metadata collected by [the script][generate-popular-actions].

Note that the version of this repository is for command line tool `actionlint`. So it does not represent version of the
library, meant that patch version bump may introduce some breaking changes.

# Testing

- All examples in ['Checks' section](#checks) are tested in [`example_test.go`](./example_test.go)
- I cloned GitHub top 1000 repositories and extracted 1400+ workflow files. And I tried actionlint with the collected workflow
  files. All bugs found while the trial were fixed and I confirmed no more false positives.

# Bug reporting

When you 're seeing some bugs or false positives, it is helpful to [file a new issue][issue-form] with a minimal example
of input. Giving me some feedbacks like feature requests or idea of additional checks is also welcome.
